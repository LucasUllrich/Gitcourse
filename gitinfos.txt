working directory -(git add)> staging area -(git commit)> repository

git branch
	lists the branches available

git branch branch_name
	creates a new branch named according to the branch_name

git branch -d branch_name
	deletes the branch with the given name (only the label, the commits remain but will be unpossible to find if the branch isn't merged before)

git checkout SHA
	To check out repo at the time of the commit.

git checkout -b branch_name
	Stores current checkout state (time in history of commits selected by SHA) to a new branch

git checkout master
	checks out to the master branch

git checkout existing_branch
	checks out to the existing branch

git diff
	Compares staging area and working directory

git diff --staged
	Compares staging area to repository

git diff -u file1 file2		|| git diff -u SHA1 SHA2
	Shows changes between two files or commits, -u is for unified and obligatory

git log -n<Number>
	shows only the specified number of commits

git log --stat
	Detailed info to different commits

git log --graph --oneline [branch1] [branchn]
	shows commit-history in a oneline-output of the given branches

git merge branch1 [branch2]
	Merges currently checked out branch with the stated branches (e.q. 3 possible), if one of them is the checked out one they will both be merged
	The new commit points to the previously checked out branch
	The order in which branch1 and branch2 are typed in does not matter since the new commit points to the checked out branch

git merge --abort
	Aborts the current merging process and restores the files to the previous state.

git reset --hard
	Resets changes in staging area and working directory -> they are equal to the repository now

Errors:
Should not be doing an octopus
	Octopus is a strategy Git uses to combine many different versions of code together. This message can appear if you try to use this strategy in an inappropriate situation.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state
	HEAD is what Git calls the commit you are currently on. You can “detach” the HEAD by switching to a previous commit, which we’ll see in the next video. Despite what it sounds like, it’s actually not a bad thing to detach the HEAD. Git just warns you so that you’ll realize you’re doing it.

Mergeconflict:
<<<<<HEAD
	Current code on branch or to be commited
|||||| merged common ancestors
	Original version of both modified file
======
	Code on master branch
>>>>>master
